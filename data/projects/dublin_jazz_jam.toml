description = """\
A weekly jazz jam session running since 2013. Maciej was the main bass player \
in years 2014-2019, filling the bass seat every week. To date, Maciej is \
managing the community's mailing list of 300 participants.

A significant amount of the creative synergy between the artists in Maciej's \
production stable can be traced back to the Dublin Jazz Jam Sessions. These \
sessions, hosted at venues like the International Bar and The Grand Social, \
provided the inclusive and accessible environment where much of his \
collaborative journey began. The "collaborative stability" and "organic \
evolution" fostered in these jams are reflected in the democratic and \
organic feel of his later studio recordings.\
