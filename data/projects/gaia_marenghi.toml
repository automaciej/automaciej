description = """\
Gaia Marenghi is an artist who views music as a profound medium for \
conversation. Her work is a "talkative" dialogue between the melodic elegance \
of her Italian roots and the intricate, rhythmic textures of modern ensemble \
play.

In her partnership with producer Maciej Bliziński, Marenghi has developed a \
sound that transcends genre boundaries, weaving together elements of \
sophisticated pop and acoustic jazz. Backed by the global rhythmic \
sensibilities of drummer Riccardo Marenghi and the lyrical violin work of \
Oleg Bezuglov, Gaia’s performances are characterized by an articulate \
intimacy and a commitment to collaborative excellence.\
