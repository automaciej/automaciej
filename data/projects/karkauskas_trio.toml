description = """\
A jazz trio with pianist Gediminas Karkauskas and drummer Riccardo Marenghi. \
The repertoire spans jazz standards and original compositions from \
Karkauskas's critically acclaimed album "Lost Suite." The trio performed \
at venues including the National Concert Hall, Scott's Jazz Club in \
Belfast, the Newpark School of Music, and the Wexford Arts Centre.

The presence of Riccardo Marenghi, an Italian-born drummer trained at \
Milan's prestigious C.E.M.M. Institute and influenced by West African and \
Afro-Cuban traditions, provides a sophisticated bedrock for the trio's \
performances. This rhythmic depth allows for a high degree of \
intellectual and emotional freedom in the ensemble's interactions.\
