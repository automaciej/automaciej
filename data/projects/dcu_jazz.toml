description = """\
Invited by the department to serve as a bass player in student ensemble classes, \
filling a structural gap caused by insufficient bass players in the student intake. \
Participated regularly in ensemble sessions over two academic years, contributing \
to the musical completeness of the bands. Involvement extended to examination \
scenarios, where my presence as bassist made it possible to assess students' \
comping and ensemble responsiveness in a full-band context. Unpaid volunteer role, \
facilitated through an existing professional relationship within the Dublin jazz \
community.\
