description = """\
Zoe Hayter is a modern troubadour whose music is forged in the fires of \
European street theatre and physical storytelling. Born into the legacy of the \
Footsbarn Travelling Theatre, Zoe has spent her life performing in venues \
ranging from village squares to the world’s largest festival stages. Her \
voice, described as rustic and angelic in the same breath, carries the weight \
of her English-Czech heritage and the technical precision of her Parisian \
theatre training.

In collaboration with Maciej Bliziński, she has crafted a sound that is both \
intimate and anthemic, moving from delicate folk to soaring, band-driven rock. \
The partnership explores a rich, ensemble-driven aesthetic that utilizes the \
full range of her theatrical background, blending raw emotional honesty with \
modern, grounded foundations.\
