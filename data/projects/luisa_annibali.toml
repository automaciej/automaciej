description = """\
Luisa Annibali is a defining presence in the Irish jazz landscape, a performer \
whose music is a vibrant collision of Roman melodic elegance and the \
infectious warmth of Brazilian rhythms. Her journey from the courtrooms of \
Italy to the jazz stages of Dublin has imbued her work with a sense of purpose \
and a fearless commitment to genre-blending.

Whether leading her Quintet through sophisticated modern jazz arrangements or \
exploring the traditional roots of Samba and Choro with the Brasilidades \
project, Luisa’s voice remains distinctly her own—deeply personal, boldly \
contemporary, and irresistibly uplifting. Her 2025 albums, Libera and \
Tentativa, recorded and mixed in collaboration with Maciej Bliziński, \
showcase an artist who weaves together empowering lyricism and feminist \
themes with the timeless elegance of the jazz tradition.\
