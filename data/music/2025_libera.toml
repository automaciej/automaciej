description = """\
"Libera" is a landmark solo album from Luisa Annibali, representing the \
culmination of five years of songwriting. It blends jazz with Italian lyrics \
and Latin rhythms, drawing comparisons to artists like Esperanza Spalding and \
Gretchen Parlato.

The album showcases Luisa's fearless genre-blending, incorporating Italian \
melodic richness, Brazilian rhythms, and modern neo-soul influences. Maciej's \
involvement in the vocal recording and mixing ensured that the expressive \
vocals and boundless energy of the performance were captured with pristine \
clarity.\
