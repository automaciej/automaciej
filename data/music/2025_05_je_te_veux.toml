description = """\
This single highlights Zoe Hayter’s French heritage and her ability to blend \
intimate storytelling with a charming linguistic delivery. The track is \
enriched by a timeless jazzy violin melody and explores themes of desire \
and the appreciation of a fleeting moment.

In collaboration with Maciej Bliziński, Zoe has crafted a sound that is both \
intimate and anthemic, utilizing the full range of her theatrical \
background. Maciej's double bass and piano provide a jazz-inflected acoustic \
resonance that complements Hayter's vocal character.\
