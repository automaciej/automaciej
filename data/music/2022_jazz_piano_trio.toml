Jazz piano trio performing in 5/4 time signature.

The presence of Riccardo Marenghi, an Italian-born drummer trained at \
Milan's prestigious C.E.M.M. Institute and influenced by West African and \
Afro-Cuban traditions, provides a sophisticated bedrock for the trio's \
exploration of complex time signatures. This rhythmic depth allow the \
ensemble to navigate the 5/4 meter with intellectual and emotional \
freedom.\
