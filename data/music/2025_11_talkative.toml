description = """\
"Talkative" serves as the primary exemplar of the Marenghi-Bliziński \
partnership. Co-written by the artist and the producer, the track is a \
multi-layered composition that features a unique instrumentation blend, \
including violin by Oleg Bezuglov.

The narrative surrounding the track is one of intellectual exchange. The title \
implies a focus on communication, a theme that is reflected in the \
arrangement where the voice, violin, and percussion engage in a dynamic \
dialogue, weaving together elements of sophisticated pop and acoustic jazz.\
