description = """\
Inspired by the Czech proverb "Naděje umírá poslední" (hope dies last), this \
single production functions as a heartfelt praise to hope. The song \
demonstrates a maturation into a rich, ensemble-driven aesthetic that \
utilizes the full range of Zoe Hayter's theatrical background.

The track features a dynamic build from quiet vulnerability into an \
energetic, band-driven anthem. The violin work by Rafał Szydłowski acts as \
the metaphorical "voice of hope," while Maciej Bliziński’s piano and electric \
bass provide a modern, grounded foundation for Zoe's rustic and angelic \
vocals.\
