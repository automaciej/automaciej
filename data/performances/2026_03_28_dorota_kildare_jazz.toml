description = """\
Blooming Rooms is a new collaborative project shaped by the idea, echoed \
recently by Marina Abramović, that artists can shift collective energy through \
intentional creation.

Dorota Konchevska is an experimental powerhouse whose work transcends the \
boundaries of traditional music to become a visceral multimedia experience. \
A Polish-born producer and composer based in Ireland, Dorota uses her \
background in music technology and electronic manipulation to create \
soundscapes that are as haunting as they are beautiful. Her "enigmatic \
rituals" of sound and image explore the deep-seated human fears and \
desires, drawing inspiration from the avant-garde traditions of the School \
of Paris.\
