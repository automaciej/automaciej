description = """\
In “Pstryk!”, we will explore Polish onomatopeias (pstryki, skrzypy, grzmoty i
pluski!) inspired by Kasia’s multisensory theatre “Little Dream”, and infused
with the magic of Polish fairytales. Designed for children aged 3-6, “Pstryk!”
seeks to create an immersive and imaginative space where young participants can
delve into the realms of dreams and nightmares. Through a holistic approach, the
workshop includes Creative Movement, Creative Voice, Storytelling drawing
inspiration from Polish folklore, and Sound Healing to introduce children to the
magical world of sounds. “Pstryk!” encourages creativity, self-expression,
teamwork and a sense of wonder. Led by Kasia Eliasz and joined by Maciej
Blizinski on Double Bass.
