Maciej grew up in a musical family in Warsaw, Poland. Maciej's earliest musical
influences are George Duke, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Antônio Carlos Jobim,
and João Gilberto.

Maciej picked up his father's electric guitar at 19. In the early 2000s, Maciej
studied sound engineering at the Chopin University of Music (UMFC), and led a
jazz and an acid jazz group. After the move to Dublin, Ireland, Maciej taught
himself electric bass. Since 2013, Maciej co-organizes and plays at the weekly
[Dublin Jazz Jam Session][jam].  Since 2022, Maciej fills the bass seat at
ensemble classes at the Jazz and Contemporary Music Performance course in Dublin
College University (uncredited).
