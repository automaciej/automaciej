## Bass

As a bass player I specialize in jazz, and a number of styles of Brazilian
music: bossa nova, samba, and chorinho. I usually play in the Dublin area [with
various artists][perf], jazz and otherwise.

I am a member of [Pstryk!][pstrykinsta], an interactive [performance for
children][pstryk].
