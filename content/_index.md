I'm a producer-turned-musicmaker. Going back to my roots, thirty-five years
back in time. Currently focused entirely on an original music project,
collaboration across time.

Not taking on new production work.

## Musical Background

My path began in Warsaw's musical scene, leading jazz and acid jazz bands
before moving to Dublin in 2007. I spent years developing my ear through live
performance - from co-organizing Dublin Jazz Jam Sessions to working with
artists like pianist [Gediminas Karkauskas][ged] and drummer [Riccardo
Marenghi][ric].

See my [music production work][mus] I did for other artists.
