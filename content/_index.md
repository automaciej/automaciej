I'm a musician and software developer based in Dublin, Ireland.

I'm currently working on **Tostarista**—an album bringing my late father's guitar compositions to life. He recorded them on cassette tapes in the 1980s. I'm transforming them into full productions.

I spent 16 years as a Site Reliability Engineer at Google, building systems that don't break and collaborating with teams worldwide. I bring that same discipline and depth to music and app development.

I occasionally collaborate on music projects that excite me artistically. I'm not taking general music production work.
