Since importance is such a central concept of Task Compass, let's try to define
it.

<!--more-->

For the purpose of using the application, you don't need a rigid definition. You
can simply use your internal feeling: what _feels_ more important to you? Your
intuition is often the best guide.

If you prefer a more analytical approach, you can ask yourself this question:

> **How bad would the consequences be if I never did this?**

Let's take filing your taxes as an example. The deadline might be months away,
so it isn't urgent. But the consequences of *never* doing it are severe. The
importance of the task is high, even when the urgency is low.

Task Compass is designed to steer you away from the "tyranny of the urgent" and
towards what is truly important. The [Eisenhower Matrix]({{% relref
eisenhower-matrix.md %}}) is a helpful mental model for understanding this
distinction.
