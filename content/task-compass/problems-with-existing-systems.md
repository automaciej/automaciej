## Problems with existing systems

### 1. Overcategorizing

Many productivity systems are built on the premise that if you just had more
features, you could finally get organized. They offer time tracking,
dependencies, and parallel ways to categorize your work.

I guess the idea is that you'd be able to use filtering and various views of
your tasks to find the task to work on. But this created extra work for me to
annotate all those tasks, and then in practice, I found that I still didn't use
this filtering, I always needed to "see all the tasks" to make sure I didn't
miss anything. I'd still scan the whole list in search for what's most
[important][imp].

[imp]: {{% relref importance.md %}} "What is importance?"

### 2. Wasted mental effort

Systems using absolute priorities [require you to keep re-eassessing the same
tasks][absprio]. That's wasted mental effort. Our brains recognize it and we
find that over time it becomes more and more difficult to keep the priority
buckets up to date.

This is the first problem with absolute priorities.

[absprio]: {{% relref "absolute-priorities.md" %}}

### 3. Human brain is not suited for absolute judgements

_This applies to most existing systems, including the Priority setting in Apple
Reminders._

The second problem is even bigger, even if you somehow maintained the discipline
to keep your top priority bucket lean. Humans are notoriously bad at assigning
absolute ratings to complex issues. Assigning an absolute rating requires you to
keep some sort of an abstract hierarchy in your mind, and to compare your tasks
against it. These ratings are notoriously inconsistent. They also might be
uprootted by new context.

My half-joking example is that you might have the "save the world" task which
looks like it would always be the top priority, but tomorrow you might get a
task which is "save two worlds"! This is a fundamental limitation of an absolute
scoring system.

| Today |  Tomorrow |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Save the world | 1. Save two worlds (?) |
| 2. ... | 2. Save the world |
| 3. ... | 3. ... |
