Task Compass guides you through task prioritization and execution.

<!--more-->

Task Compass is your friend in using Apple Reminders as a TODO list.

Unlike traditional manual systems, Task Compass is semi-automatic: you decide
the priorities, while the app drives the process. Your role is to decide on
trade-offs:

{{< reminder_comparison
    title1="Buy milk" desc1="1L, full"
    title2="Bring the coat to the tailor" desc2="Remember the buttons"
    >}}

The app instantly analyzes your decisions, asks for more comparisons as needed,
and presents you with your most important task.

{{< priority_task
    title="Bring the coat to the tailor"
    description="Remember the buttons" label="Your #1 priority"
    >}}

Then it keeps it easy to keep your list prioritized as you add more tasks.

## Integration with Apple Reminders

The best tools are the ones that fit into your existing workflow. Task Compass
is not another to-do list app; it's a layer of automation that sits on top of
the to-do list you already use: **Apple Reminders**. There's no accounts,
passwords, data migration, no new systems to learn.

## A Compass, Not a Map

Task Compass is not a map that shows you every possible path. It's a compass
that points you in the right direction, one step at a time.

The vision is to create a tool that feels less like a piece of software and more
like a trusted advisor—one that understands your goals and helps you stay
focused on the work that truly matters.
