### We Don't Collect Any User Data

We do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal information.
All data remains on your device and in your personal iCloud account.

### Information The App Accesses

**Reminders Data**: Task Compass accesses your Apple Reminders to display and
help you prioritize your tasks. This data remains on your device and in your
iCloud account.

**Task Comparisons**: The app stores your importance and difficulty rankings for
tasks locally on your device and syncs them across your devices using Apple's
iCloud service.

### How The App Uses Your Information

- To display your reminders within the app for prioritization
- To save and sync your task rankings across your Apple devices
- To provide the Eisenhower Matrix categorization of your tasks

### Data Storage and No Sharing

**Local Storage**: All app data is stored locally on your device using Apple's
secure storage systems.

**iCloud Sync**: Your task rankings sync across your devices through Apple's
iCloud service. This data remains locked in your personal iCloud account.

**No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not collect, store, or share your data with
any third parties. All data remains within Apple's ecosystem (your device and
your iCloud account).
