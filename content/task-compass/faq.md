## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Task Compass for me?

Task Compass will help you if:

-   You feel overwhelmed by long to-do lists and don't know where to start.
-   You know what's important but find it hard to get started on those tasks.
-   You want a clear, focused priority list without the manual effort.

### Is there anyone it's NOT for?

This app probably isn't for you if:

-   You don't use to-do lists.
-   You need complex project management features like dependencies or detailed
    time tracking.

### Why do I get stuck when I try to prioritize my to-do list?

Staring at a long list of tasks tires you out incredibly quickly. Your brain
gets overwhelmed trying to juggle everything, which makes it nearly impossible
to decide what to tackle first. This is why trying to rate tasks from 1 to 10
often fails—you end up giving everything the same score. The problem isn't you;
it's that our brains aren't built to assign absolute importance to a long list
of items all at once.

### How does Task Compass fix this?

Instead of asking you to assign priorities or ratings, it asks you to make one
choice at a time: **"Which is more important: Task A or Task B?"**

This works because:

-   **It feels natural.** You're good at comparing two things directly.
-   **It saves mental energy.** You only have to think about the two tasks in
    front of you, not the entire list.
-   **It works with you.** The app takes your simple, "good enough" choices and
    uses them to build a clear, optimized priority list for you.

### What if I know a task is important but still avoid it?

This is a classic problem. You know something is a top priority, but you find
yourself doing other, less important things instead. This happens when you feel
a sense of resistance or "friction" towards a task. Knowing something is
important doesn't always give you the energy to start it.

### How does Task Compass handle my procrastination?

Other apps make you manually tag tasks when you feel resistance. Task Compass is
smarter: it **learns from your actions**. It notices when an important task sits
on your list for days while you complete other, less important ones.

When it sees this pattern, it recognizes that you're avoiding the task. It then
combines what you've *told* it is important with what it *sees* you doing to
help you get unstuck.

### How does it work, step-by-step?

1.  **You make simple choices.** Just answer a few "A or B" questions. The app's
    smart algorithm quickly figures out your top priorities.
2.  **You get to work.** Once your #1 priority is clear, you can start the
    built-in Pomodoro timer and focus on that one task.
3.  **You get unstuck.** The app notices when you're avoiding an important task
    and gently prompts you to schedule it, helping you break through
    procrastination.

You just make the easy choices. The app does the heavy lifting.

### Does it work with my existing to-do list?

Yes. Task Compass integrates directly with **Apple Reminders**. All your
existing tasks and lists sync automatically, so you don't have to migrate any
data or manage two different systems.

### What if importances change?

This doesn't happen as often as you might think. Urgency can change quickly, but
[importance is more stable than urgency]({{% relref importance.md %}}).

### Does Task Compass use Eisenhower Matrix?

Yes, but not the traditional version which focuses on importance vs urgency.
Task Compass uses importance vs resistance as the matrix dimensions.
