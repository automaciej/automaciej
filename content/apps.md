# Apps

I build tools that solve real problems I encounter as a musician and creative professional.

## Time Feel
**Interactive Metronome for Serious Musicians**

Traditional metronomes just click. Time Feel helps you develop your internal sense of time through interactive exercises.

Built because I needed it as a bassist. Made it professional-grade because I spent 16 years at Google learning how to build things that work.

## Task Compass
**Priority Tool for People Who Think Differently**

Combines stack ranking with Eisenhower matrix. Gets you unstuck when you have too many things competing for attention.

Built because standard productivity apps assume everyone's brain works the same way. Mine doesn't.

## Development Philosophy

After 16 years building systems at scale, I know how to make software that doesn't break. These apps are:
- Native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI)
- Privacy-focused (no data harvesting)
- Designed for power users who care about quality

More apps in development. Each one solves a problem I actually have.
