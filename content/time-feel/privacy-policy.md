## Privacy Policy for Time Feel

**Effective Date:** 2025-09-21

### We Don't Collect Any User Data

We do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal information.
All data remains on your device.

### Information The App Stores

**Tempo Settings**: Time Feel stores your last played tempo locally on your
device to restore your preferred setting when you reopen the app.

**Subdivision Settings**: The app stores your last used subdivision (quarter
notes, eighth notes, etc.) locally on your device for convenience.

### How The App Uses Your Information

- To remember your last tempo setting for a seamless practice experience
- To restore your preferred subdivision when you restart the app
- To provide consistent timing feedback during your practice sessions

### Data Storage and No Sharing

**Local Storage Only**: All app data is stored locally on your device using
Apple's secure storage systems. No data is synchronized via the network.

**No Cloud Sync**: Unlike many apps, Time Feel does not sync your settings
across devices. Each device maintains its own local preferences.

**No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not collect, store, or share your data with
any third parties. All data remains exclusively on your device.

**Developer Access**: We have no access to your data. The tempo and subdivision
settings are stored only in your device's local storage.

### Audio Processing

**Microphone Access**: Time Feel uses your device's microphone to analyze your
playing for timing feedback. This audio processing happens in real-time and
locally on your device.

**No Audio Storage**: The app transforms audio input into visual graphics for
screen display and immediately discards the audio data. No audio is ever stored
on your device - the app only keeps the visual representation for display
purposes, then discards that too as new audio comes in.

### Data Security

Your minimal app settings are protected by Apple's security measures for local
device storage. No data ever leaves your device.
