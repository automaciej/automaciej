**Maciej** _(pron. MATCH-ek)_ **Bliziński** is an electric bass player based in
Dublin, Ireland. Maciej specializes in jazz, and a number styles of Brazilian
music: bossa nova, samba, and chorinho.  Maciej also plays nylon string and
electric guitars, produces music recordings, and develops own music software.

Maciej grew up in a musical family in Warsaw, Poland. Maciej's earliest musical
influences are George Duke, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Antônio Carlos Jobim,
and João Gilberto. Some of Maciej's bass influences are James Jamerson, Ron
Carter, Stuart Zender, and Nathan East.

Maciej picked up his father's electric guitar at 19. In the early 2000s, Maciej
led Funksters, an acid jazz band. After the move to Dublin, Maciej taught
himself to play electric bass. Since 2013, Maciej co-organizes and plays at the
weekly [Dublin Jazz Jam Session](https://facebook.com/dublinjazzjam). Since
2022, Maciej fills the bass seat at ensemble classes in Dublin College
University.

As of autumn 2022, Maciej participates in several music projects, plays
regularly at the jazz jam session, works on own arrangements of bossa nova
classics, and organizes weekly music making sessions.
