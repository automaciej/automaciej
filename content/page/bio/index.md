Maciej grew up in a musical family in Warsaw, Poland. Maciej's earliest musical
influences are George Duke, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Antônio Carlos Jobim,
and João Gilberto. Some of Maciej's bass influences are James Jamerson, Ron
Carter, Stuart Zender, and Nathan East.

Maciej picked up his father's electric guitar at 19. In the early 2000s, Maciej
studied sound engineering and led a jazz and an acid jazz group. After the move
to Dublin, Ireland, Maciej taught himself electric bass. Since 2013, Maciej
co-organizes and plays at the weekly [Dublin Jazz Jam Session][jam].  Since
2022, Maciej fills the bass seat at ensemble classes at the Jazz and
Contemporary Music Performance course in Dublin College University (uncredited).

As of summer 2023, Maciej collaborates with pianist [Gediminas Karkauskas][ged]
and drummer [Riccardo Marenghi][ric] in a jazz trio.
