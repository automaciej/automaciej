Maciej, raised in a [musical family][marek] in Warsaw, Poland, was inspired
early on by artists like George Duke, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Antônio
Carlos Jobim, and João Gilberto. Though he initially picked up guitar, Maciej
always felt more at home with bass. His switch from guitar to bass was a
turning point, allowing him to connect deeply with the groove between the drums
and harmonic instruments—a natural fit for both his playing style and his later
work as a producer.

Maciej studied sound engineering at the Chopin University of Music, leading
jazz and acid jazz bands before moving to Dublin in 2007. There, he taught
himself electric bass and co-organized the [Dublin Jazz Jam Sessions][jam] from
2013, developing his walking bass skills and deepening his repertoire of tunes.
The years of production work that followed taught him how music gets built from
the ground up: microphone placement, phase alignment, the weight of silence,
how instruments breathe together.

A proud moment in his career was co-writing for his band Funksters in Poland,
whose members have since gone on to successful careers. His collaboration with
pianist [Gediminas Karkauskas][ged] and drummer [Riccardo Marenghi][ric],
particularly their performance at Scott's Jazz Club in Belfast, represented the
culmination of his collaborative work.

Now Maciej has turned that [accumulated knowledge][mus] toward his own music.
After decades of helping others realize their visions, he's focused entirely on
original music creation—going back to his roots, collaborating across time.
