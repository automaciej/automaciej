Maciej, raised in a musical family in Warsaw, Poland, was inspired early on by
artists like George Duke, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Antônio Carlos Jobim, and
João Gilberto. Though he initially picked up guitar, Maciej always felt more at
home with bass. His switch from guitar to bass was a turning point, allowing him
to connect deeply with the groove between the drums and harmonic
instruments&ndash;a natural fit for both his playing style and his work as a
producer.

Maciej studied sound engineering at the Chopin University of Music, leading jazz
and acid jazz bands before moving to Dublin in 2007. There, he taught himself
electric bass and began co-organizing the Dublin Jazz Jam Sessions in 2013,
where he often anchors the sessions as the main bass player, helping musicians
gel and ensuring tight backing for vocalists. These sessions have honed his
walking bass skills and deepened his repertoire of tunes.

In his home studio in North Dublin, Maciej takes a [natural, organic
approach][appr]) to recording and mixing. He prefers live recordings, rather
than track-by-track, capturing performances that breathe and feel authentic. His
meticulous attention to microphone placement, phase alignment, and ambience
allows him to mix with a blend of classical techniques and modern digital tools.

A proud moment in his career was co-writing for his band Funksters in Poland,
whose members have since gone on to successful careers. These days, Maciej is
most proud of his work with pianist [Gediminas Karkauskas][ged] and drummer
[Riccardo Marenghi][ric], particularly their recent performance at Scott’s Jazz
Club in Belfast.

Looking ahead, Maciej is focused on original music creation, whether for himself
or in collaboration with others. His dream is to write and release songs,
helping artists bring their creative visions to life through his [production
work]({{< relref "music/_index.md" >}}). Ultimately, it's the act of creating
something new that fuels his passion, making music the art form closest to his
heart.
